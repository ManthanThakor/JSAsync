## JavaScript Callbacks

============================

"I will call back later!"

- Theory: A callback is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside that function.
- Callbacks are a way to ensure that certain code doesn't execute until other code has finished executing.

## Disadvantages of Callbacks

============================

- Callback Hell: When using callbacks, especially in nested situations, the code can become difficult to read and maintain. This is often referred to as "callback hell" or "pyramid of doom."
